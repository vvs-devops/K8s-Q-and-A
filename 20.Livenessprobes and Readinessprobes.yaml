Liveness and Readiness probes are used to control the health of an application running inside a pods container.
Liveness probes
   suppose that a pod is running our application inside a container but due to some reasons lets say memory leak,cpu usage. application deadlock ect the application is not responding to our requests, and stuck in error state.
   Liveness probes checks the container health as well tell it do , and if for some reasosn the liveness probe fsil it restart the container.
Readiness probe
  This type of probes is used to detect if a container is ready to accept trafic.You can use this probe to manage which pods are used as backends for load balancing services. if apod is not ready , it can then be removed from the list of load balances.
